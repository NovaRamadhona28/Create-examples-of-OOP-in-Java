1. Encapsulation
     The purpose of encapsulation is to wrap a class and keep whatever is in that class, 
     both methods and attribute, so that it cannot be accessed by other classes.

2. Inheritance
    Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a technique in which a class can inherit 
    its attributes and methods in other classes (called subclasses).

3. Polymorphims 
    Polymorphims means different classes but come from one parent can have the same 
    method but different ways of implementing it. Or in other words, a fuction will have 
    different behavior if passed o different classes.

4. Abstraction 
    Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from user. Only the 
   functionality will be provided the user. in Java, abstraction is achieved using abstraction 
   classes and interfaces.
